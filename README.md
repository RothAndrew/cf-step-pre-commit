# cf-step-pre-commit

CodeFresh Step to run pre-commit validation

Runs "pre-commit run -a" to validate that all [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) git hooks are passing.
Uses [Dad's Garage](https://github.com/dadsgarage/dadsgarage) as the runtime container.
Submit issues in either the step repo or the Dad's Garage repo if you have problems.
